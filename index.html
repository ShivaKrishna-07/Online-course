                Our journalism masterclasses represent a place where the academy welcomes key players from the media industries, and students who engage in journalism practice and study learn at first-hand about their preoccupations, concerns and experiences. Those who report, present, manage, regulate or simply reflect on the rapidly changing media world give an insight into the industries our students aspire to join.
<br><br>
We regard the masterclasses as an essential element of applied journalism knowledge, and as such they are compulsory for all students taking BA Journalism Studies and MA Journalism. Students on other degree programmes are also very welcome to join.
